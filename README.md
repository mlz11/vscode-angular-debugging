# Debugging Angular Application in Visual Studio Code

This repository provides Visual Studio Code configuration files (`launch.json` and `tasks.json`) that enable debugging an Angular application directly from within Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed on your machine.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed globally.

## Setup Instructions

## Configuration Files

### `launch.json`

The `launch.json` file contains configurations for debugging your Angular application in Visual Studio Code. It includes settings for launching the Angular development server and attaching the debugger.

### `tasks.json`

The `tasks.json` file defines tasks that can be executed from within Visual Studio Code. It includes a task for starting the Angular development server.

## Usage

1. Open your Angular project in Visual Studio Code

2. Press `F5` or navigate to the Debug panel and click on the "Start Debugging" button to launch the Angular application in debugging mode.

3. Set breakpoints in your TypeScript code as needed.

## Supported Angular Versions

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your Angular application is set up correctly and you can run it using `ng serve` before attempting to debug it.
